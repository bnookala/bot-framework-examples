Hi! These are a few examples of bots I wrote and demonstrated in various talks.
Hoping that they're useful for you.

To run them, you'll need to do the following:

1. Set up an emulator (Windows only for rich messaging support): https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/
2. `cd` into the directory of each bot type
3. `npm install`
4. `node first_example.js` or `node second_example.js`

If you've set up the emulator properly, it will immediately start sending messages to the endpoint specified.
